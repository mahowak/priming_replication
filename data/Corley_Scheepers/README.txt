Data from Corley and Scheepers (2002, PB&R)
Note: 66 subjects tested, but 12 were excluded (see paper), giving 54 valid subjects
File only contains those 54 valid subjects.
 
Variables are:

Subject_ID: arbitrary integer

item: 1-32

trial_numb (serial position in experiment): integer

cond (originally intended condition): 01=same verb/PO, 02=same verb/DO, 03=diff verb/PO, 04=diff verb/DO

prime_resp (actual prime response): "ZZ" means "other"

Vcond (verb condition): 1=same, 2=different

Ptype (prime type): 1=PO, 2=DO, 3=other

target_resp (actual target response): "ZZ" means "other"

Ttype (target type): 1=PO, 2=DO, 3=other

T_onset: target response onset latency (in ms) relative to target-fragment onset

P_onset: prime response onset latency (in ms) relative to prime-fragment onset

P_offset: prime response offset latency (in ms)	relative to prime-fragment onset

trialT: the sum of the above latencies (in ms)
